Questioning about the texture of reality, society and human nature can be seen as getting lost in space. 

This blog is named after 1995's 3D Pinball: Space Cadet and Dead Space by Visceral Games.

So if as a human you feel terror of vastness and the unknown, don't worry, go with the flow.

Tilt hard the playground and stomp on space zombies.

Space Cadet is also the name of a Kyuss piece that was in my mind as well when i tought of this blog.
