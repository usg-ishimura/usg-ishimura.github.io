# Welcome to Community Logs!

This place is open to people who want to express themselves with their own style and create blog posts of what is on their mind. Could be articles, shitposts, self reflections or technical guides. 
Following posting rules any idea can come to life on this blog.

Create a new file in `_posts` folder of [CommunityLogs/communitylogs.github.io](https://github.com/CommunityLogs/communitylogs.github.io) repository and 
name it `YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-name.md` where `YYYY` is current year, `MM` current month and `DD` current day, 
don't use future dates because if so the post won't show, `blog-post-name` could be any name you want but every word must
be separated by `-`.

---

New created file must start with:
```
---
author: John Doe
facebook_username: john.doe
twitter_username: johndoe
google_username: johndoe
linkedin_username: johndoe
instagram_username: johndoe
github_username: johndoe
tags: template-post 
---
```
Replace `John Doe` with your name, and your social media usernames, social media usernames are not mandatory they are there so people can follow you if interested in your content, delete the specific social media line if you won't provide that social media username. Type just one tag with no spaces that describe your post. You can write blog posts in whatever language you want, content will be indexed and shown on search engines.

Posts are written in markdown, if you don’t know it, don’t worry, there’s not much to it. See [this post by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to learn some of the basics.

You can embed images and gifs directly by dropping them in github editor while you write the post and see how the content will be displayed by clicking on the preview tab.
